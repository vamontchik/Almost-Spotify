# Project Proposal

##### Proposal

For this project, I'll implement a windowed application that allows the user to
create and traverse a collection of song files that they have stored locally.
This is done by specifying the paths to where the program will look for audio
files, and then populate the screen with selections from all those locations.
It will specify the name, length, size, and path location for each song. The
user will be able to select a file and then have it play out through standard
audio output, and a progress bar with a current time and total time will
appear on either side.

##### Additional assets

As for additional assets, I'll use the openFrameworks addon 'ofxGui,' which allows
for an easier implementation of some of the graphics details (ex. the slider
that would follow at what point the song is at.)
