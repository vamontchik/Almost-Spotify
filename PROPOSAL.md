# Project Proposal

For this project, I'll implement a windowed application that allows the user
to specify and play a music file of choice (type of music files bound by
openFrameworks). While this music file is playing, the program will draw an
audio spectrum representation of the music. Given enough time, the spectrum
may be changed to be circular in shape (instead of a horizontal line), and
various visual fx may be implemented.

As for additional assets, I'll use the openFrameworks addon 'ofxFft', which will
be used to both simplify the math and coding surrounding applying the fast fourier
transformation on the input data, which is part of the procedure for turning audio
data into a spectrum.
